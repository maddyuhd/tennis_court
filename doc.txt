*preprocess
 -image resize by half (to improve performance)
 -converted image to HSV 
 -filtered out based on white color with sensitivity variable 

*skeletonize
 -skeletonize the preprocessed image to improve the accuracy of line detection

*line detection
 -using HoughLines 
  -if at least 6 lines at found:
  helper Class Line is used for storing the x,y coordinate 
  of the line as well as mid pt of the line and all the objects are stored in an array
  
  the array  is sorted according to the required classification
   - base line (sorted based on y coordinate of the mid point)
    poped the value in the first and last index(top and bottom line)
    AS it reduces the values to be sorted for 
    like wise for single and double sideline (based on x coordinate)
    
   -Classification based on horizontal and vertical lines didn't always work out
