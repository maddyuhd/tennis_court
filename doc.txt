*preprocess
 -image resize by half (to improve performance)
 -converted image to HSV 
 -filtered out based on white color with sensitivity variable (that can be changed if required)

*skeletonize
 -skeletonize the preprocessed image to improve the accuracy of line detection

*line detection
 -Used HoughLines for detecting line
 -At least 6 lines is required
 -Helper Class Line is used for storing the x,y coordinate 
  of the line as well as mid pt of the line 
 -All the objects are stored in an array
  
*Classification
 -The array  is sorted according to the required classification
 - Base line (sorted based on y coordinate of the mid point)
  the value in the first and last index(top and bottom line) are poped
  (As it reduces the values to be sorted next and the same line is not choosen again) 
  like wise for single and double sideline (based on x coordinate)
    
  *Note
  -Classification based on horizontal and vertical lines didn't always work out.
